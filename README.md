# OSx-UI-API-
In this project, we made an UI for the file sharing platform .
The project have two versions
1. OSx UI(Api Version)
2. OSx UI (String Manipulation version)
  In the OSx UI the folders are generated as simililar to the FINDER of Apple (Mac).
  the project was developed for the ease of the customer for downloading there IMAGES in the easy way.
  This UI guide them folderwise towards there ultimate goal of getting the images or to view them.
  
  
  The project is purely based on the java script and AJAX(for calling the API). there's no other libraries are used.
  And for the front-end view the BOOTSTRAP is used.
  The API based version is limited to the 3 level of the foldering of the item for example--
      
      AMAZON > NIKE > raindow.jpg.
      
  The no of the folder at any level can be X means that there is no limitations of the no.s
  because we creating the folders dynamically and it's totally depends on the API that how much folders they are serving as result.
